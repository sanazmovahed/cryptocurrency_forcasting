<h1>Cryptocurrency Forcasting</h1>
<p>We have some datasets of historical data for Bitcoin. we stablish some Machine Learning and Deep learning models like LSTM, RNN, GRU to predict the future prices of Bitcoin. This project gradually will be completed, be patient! ;) </p>
<p>
Here we cover the technical aspect of analysing the market behaviour. There are so many aspects that are effective on the condition of cryptocurrencies, like fundamental analysis as news, project updates, social media, ... and on-chain data and some other cases.</P>
<p>
If we succeed, we will start to cover all other aspects, mentioned above to get a more accurate result of prediction.</p>
